1. Purpose
The MP3 tag reader software is designed to read and display ID3 tag information from MP3 files.
It is a desktop-based application, not web-based. The software is useful for individuals who wish to view and collect MP3 tag data.
The project is also a foundation for extending functionality to include a tag editor, allowing users to modify MP3 tag information.

2. ID3v2.3 Tag Support
The software will focus on the ID3v2.3 tag version, ensuring compatibility with this specific version of the ID3 tag format used to store metadata in MP3 files, such as title, artist, album, year, and genre.
